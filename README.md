**Because your memory is a sieve and your digital security is a cry for help.**

Let’s be honest: you’re either using `password123` for your bank account or you have a crusty Post-it note stuck to your webcam. **uvz-auther** is a Tauri-powered key manager designed for people who want to look like "l33t hackers" while actually just being terrified of losing their API keys.

It’s fast, it’s desktop-native, and it consumes less RAM than a single Chrome tab. 


## 🖤 The Gory Details

**uvz-auther** is a minimalist vault that hides your secrets so you don't have to explain to your boss why the production keys are on a public Trello board. Built with **Tauri**, it’s lean, mean, and doesn't bloat your system like those Electron-based memory leaks.

### 🕳️ Where do the bodies go?
We don’t trust "The Cloud." The Cloud is just a fancy term for "someone else's server that's currently being raided by the feds." 

Instead, **uvz-auther** shoves your data into the local abyss:
`~/.uvz-auth-keys.env`

> **PRO-TIP:** If you delete this file, your keys are gone. If you format your drive, your keys are gone. If you accidentally `rm -rf ~` while drunk-coding, your keys are gone—and you’ll have earned the silence that follows.



## 🛠️ Summoning the App

If you have the audacity to run unvetted code from the internet (of course you do), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the nightmare:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uvz0/uvz-auther
```
2. Enter the void:
```bash
cd uvz-auther
```
3. Feed the dependencies:

```bash
npm install  # Or pnpm/yarn. Pick your favorite poison.
```

4. Invoke the spirits:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## ⚠️ The "Don't Sue Me" Clause
This software is provided "as is," which is a polite way of saying it might work, or it might turn your CPU into a very expensive space heater.

- No Warranty: If this app leaks your keys to a 14-year-old in a basement, that’s on you.

- No Support: If you forget your master password, don't email me. I don't have it. Nobody has it. God can't even help you.

- Skill Issue: uvz-auther assumes you are a semi-competent adult. If you aren't, go back to using a physical notebook and a crayon.

## 🩸 Contribution
Found a bug? Keep it as a pet. Or, if you’re feeling masochistic, open a Pull Request and try to convince me your code doesn't suck. Check CONTRIBUTING.md for the rules of engagement.

## 📜 License
Probably MIT. Or maybe I’ll just haunt your terminal if you steal the logic. Use it at your own peril.
